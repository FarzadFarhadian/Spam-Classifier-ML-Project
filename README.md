# Spam-Classifier-ML-Project

---

This project is a machine learning-based spam and SMS classifier that aims to accurately distinguish between legitimate and spam messages. The project was developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment and includes the following key stages:

1. Data Cleaning: The dataset used for training the model was cleaned to remove duplicates, irrelevant data, and other inconsistencies.

2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): The dataset was analyzed to uncover patterns and gain insights about the data.

3. Text Preprocessing: The text data in the dataset was preprocessed to prepare it for machine learning. This included tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.

4. Model Building: The preprocessed data was used to train a machine learning model. Several models were tested and evaluated to determine the best one for the task.

5. Evaluation: The performance of the final model was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Improvement: The model was refined and improved based on the evaluation results to increase its accuracy and effectiveness.

7. Website: The final model was deployed on a website, where users can input messages and receive a prediction of whether it is spam or not.

8. Deploy: The final model was deployed using different methods such as REST API, Docker to make it usable by different applications.

The code and files for this project can be found in the GitHub repository.
